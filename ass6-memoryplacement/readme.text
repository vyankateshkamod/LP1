Here's a breakdown of algorithms for **Next Fit** and **Worst Fit** memory allocation strategies, along with **First Fit** and **Best Fit** for completeness.

### 1. **Next Fit Algorithm**:
The **Next Fit** algorithm is a variation of First Fit, where it resumes searching for the next available memory block from where the last allocation occurred.

**Algorithm**:
1. Initialize `lastAllocatedIndex = -1` to track the last allocated memory block.
2. For each process in `processRequirements`:
   - Start searching for an available memory block from `lastAllocatedIndex + 1` to the end.
   - If an appropriate block is found, allocate the process, update `lastAllocatedIndex` to this blockâ€™s index, and stop searching.
   - If no block is found from the current position to the end, restart from the beginning up to `lastAllocatedIndex` and repeat the allocation attempt.
3. If no suitable memory block is found after a complete search, mark the process as unallocated.

### 2. **Worst Fit Algorithm**:
The **Worst Fit** algorithm allocates each process to the largest available memory block to leave larger contiguous spaces for future allocations.

**Algorithm**:
1. For each process in `processRequirements`:
   - Initialize `worstIndex = -1` and `worstFitSize = -1`.
   - Search all memory blocks to find the block with the largest size that can accommodate the process (satisfies `block size >= process size`).
   - If a suitable block is found, update `worstIndex` to the index of the block and `worstFitSize` to the remaining space after allocation.
   - Allocate the process to the memory block at `worstIndex`.
2. If no suitable block is found, mark the process as unallocated.

### 3. **First Fit Algorithm**:
The **First Fit** algorithm scans the memory from the beginning for each process, allocating it to the first suitable memory block.

**Algorithm**:
1. For each process in `processRequirements`:
   - Traverse the memory blocks from the start.
   - If a block satisfies `block size >= process size` and is unallocated, allocate the process to this block and break out of the loop.
2. If no suitable memory block is found during the search, mark the process as unallocated.

### 4. **Best Fit Algorithm**:
The **Best Fit** algorithm allocates each process to the smallest memory block that can still fit the process, minimizing leftover space.

**Algorithm**:
1. For each process in `processRequirements`:
   - Initialize `bestIndex = -1` and `bestFitSize = Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
   - Search all memory blocks to find the smallest block that can accommodate the process (satisfies `block size >= process size`).
   - If a suitable block is found, update `bestIndex` to the index of this block and `bestFitSize` to the remaining space after allocation.
   - Allocate the process to the memory block at `bestIndex`.
2. If no suitable block is found, mark the process as unallocated.

### Summary Table:

| Fit Algorithm | Allocation Strategy                                               | Pros                                                   | Cons                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Next Fit**  | Resumes search from last allocated block                          | Can be faster than First Fit                           | May leave larger gaps in memory                      |
| **Worst Fit** | Allocates process to the largest available block                  | Leaves larger spaces for future processes              | Tends to waste larger memory blocks                  |
| **First Fit** | Allocates process to the first suitable block                     | Fast allocation                                        | May leave unutilized memory gaps                     |
| **Best Fit**  | Allocates process to the smallest suitable block                  | Minimizes unused memory space in each block            | Tends to create many small, unusable memory segments |

These algorithms manage memory by different strategies, each with unique trade-offs in terms of speed and memory utilization efficiency.
